Players-Generator
=================

Generates a list of football player statistics, meant to be used together with a football game written in Ada.

How
===

It is purely written in Java, due to ease of development. The output is a JSON object that contains two arrays of players. Each player has its own set of characteristics.

Why
===

This project is tightly coupled with the "SDC" project. It is, in fact, one of its sub-modules. The main project can be found here: https://github.com/dextorer/SCD
